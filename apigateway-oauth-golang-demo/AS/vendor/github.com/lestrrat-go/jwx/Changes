Changes
=======

v1.0.2 - 07 May 2020
  * Since 1.0.0, we took somet time to play the test coverage game.
	  The coverage is around 30% better, and we _did_ uncover some
    inconsistencies in the API, which got promptly fixed.
    But I'm tired of the coverage game for the time being. PR's welcome!
  * Add jwk.AssignKeyID to automatically assign a `kid` field to a JWK
	* Fix jwe.Encrypt / jwe.Decrypt to properly look at the `zip` field
  * Change jwe.Message accessors to return []byte, not buffer.Buffer

v1.0.1 - 04 May 2020
	* Normalize all JWK serialization to use padding-less base64 encoding (#185)
  * Fix edge case unmarshaling openid.AddressClaim within a openid.Token
  * Fix edge case unmarshaling jwe.Message
  * Export JWK key-specific constants, such as jwk.RSANKey, jwk.SymmetricOctetsKey, etc
  * Remove some unused code

v1.0.0 - 03 May 2020
  * All packages (`jws`, `jwe`, `jwk`, `jwt`) have all been reworked from
    the ground-up.
    * These packages now hide the actual implementation of the main structs behind an interface.
    * Header/Token structs must now be instantiated using proper constructors
      (most notably, json.Unmarshal will miserably fail if you just pass
       and empty interface via `xxx.Token` or similar)
    * Token/Header interfaces are now more or less standardized.
      The following API should be consistent between all relevant packages:
      * New()
      * Get()
      * Set()
      * Remove()
      * Iterate()
      * Walk()
      * AsMap()
    * Oft-used fields are no longer directly accessible: 
      e.g. `token.KeyID = v` is no longer valid. You must set using `Set`
      (and `Remove`, if you are removing it), and use either `Get` or
      one of the utility methods such as `token.KeyID()`
    * Many helper functions and structs have been unexported. They were never
      meant to be anything useful for end-users, and hopefully it does not
      cause any problems.
    * Most errors type/instances have been removed from the public API
  * `jwt` package can now work with different token types, such as OpenID tokens.
    * `token.Sign` and `token.Verify` have been changed from methods to
      package functions `jwt.Sign` and `jwt.Verify`, to allow different
      types of tokens to be passed to the same logic.
    * Added a custom token type in `openid` sub-package to make it easier to
      work with OpenID claims
    * `jwt.Parse` (and its siblings) now accept `jwt.WithOpenIDClaims()`
  * `jwe` API has been reworked:
    * `MultiEncrypt` has been removed.
    * Serializer structs have been removed. Now you just need to call
      `jwe.Compact` or `jwe.JSON`
  * `jwk` API has been reworked:
    * `jwk.ParseKey` has been added
    * `jwk.Materialize` has been renamed to `Raw()`. A new corresponding
      method to initialize the key from a raw key (RSA/ECDSA/byte keys)
      called `FromRaw()` has also been added, which makes a nice pair.
  * `jws` API has been reworked
  * CI has been changed from Travis CI to Github Actions, and tests now
    include linting via `golangci-lint`

v0.9.2 - 15 Apr 2020 
  * Maintenance release to protect users from upcoming breaking changes

v0.9.1 - 27 Feb 2020
  * Fix error wrapping in certain cases
  * Add Claims(), Walk(), and AsMap() to iterate claims, as well as
    getting the entire data out as a single map
  * Work with alternate base64 encodings when decoding

v0.9.0 - 22 May 2019
  * Start tagging versions for good measure.
