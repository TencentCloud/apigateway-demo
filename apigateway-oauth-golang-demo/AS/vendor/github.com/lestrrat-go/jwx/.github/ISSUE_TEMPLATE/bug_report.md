**Disclaimer**
Rule number one: The authors of this project do NOT know what you are trying to accomplish. In order to understand what you are trying to accomplish, *we need code*. Except for those cases when you absolutely cannot do so, please *ALWAYS* include a standalone Go test function that shows us exactly how the code fails and what your expectations are.

Rule number two: Failing to attach a test code may result in the authors not taking up to review your report. We enjoy solving problems, but we are not your support staff. We do not get paid to do this. Please help us help you by providing us with a reproducible code.

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce / Expected behavior**
Please attach a standalone Go test code that shows the problem, and what you expected to happen.

If you are asking for an API change or some such which inhibits you from providing a working code, please do your best to come up with a near-valid code.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
